## Home Credit Risk — End-to-End Data Warehouse & ML Pipeline

This repository contains a full end-to-end credit risk prediction system built using the Home Credit Default Risk dataset.
The project is designed as a real enterprise-level workflow, combining:

Data Engineering

Data Warehouse Design (Star Schema)

ETL Pipeline

Feature Engineering

Machine Learning Models

MLflow Experiment Tracking

Model Evaluation & Monitoring

🔥 Project Highlights

Built a complete Data Warehouse with properly modeled dimensions and fact tables.

Developed a modular ETL pipeline to clean, transform, and integrate data from:

application

bureau

bureau_balance

previous applications

POS_CASH

credit card balance

installments

Created reproducible notebooks for EDA, preprocessing, and modeling.

Implemented multiple ML models to predict loan default probability.

Used MLflow to track experiments, versions, and performance metrics.

Automated the process using CI/CD workflows on GitHub Actions.

Added complete directory structure similar to real production systems.

## Goal

Build a fully reproducible, scalable system that simulates how real banks build their Credit Risk Scoring pipelines — integrating engineering + analytics + ML in one production-ready solution.

## 📌 Status

✔ In Progress – building DWH, ETL & ML pipeline step by step.
